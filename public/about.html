  <b>My name is Zhanna, I’m 21 years old, and I’m from Netishyn, Ukraine.</b><br />
  I’m a creative and sensitive person who pays attention to details and values living with awareness rather than on autopilot. It’s important for me to feel, understand, and experience life deeply.
  </p>

  <p>
    I love dance — for me, it’s more than movement. It’s a way of self-expression, a language of the body and emotions. Through dance, I can say things that are hard to put into words. I’m also drawn to language and meaning: I enjoy analyzing words, texts, and the ideas behind them.

  <p>
    Running and sports are an important part of my life. They help me build discipline, endurance, and inner balance. I care about my body and enjoy finding harmony between activity and recovery.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m deeply interested in people, psychology, relationships, and complex life choices — topics that deserve depth rather than surface-level conversations. I value honesty, tenderness, and genuine connection in communication, creativity, and everyday life.

    This website is my personal space — a reflection of my journey, my thoughts, and what I create and feel.
